# Web Design Principles


## Native UIs & Widgets

There was a time when it seemed, for a little while, that UI design was solved.
We had WIMP. We had native widgets. We had cross-platform UI widget libraries: e.g. Qt, Swing for Java. 

We had GUI builders. These were drag and drop interfaces in which you would create your windows and associate events to the various elements in the UI design. 

## The Web
And then the web happened. And everybody started doing their own widgets and designs, and programmers were free again to be creative. And we had Flash interactive-full-of-color-and-idiosyncracy websites. 

In all this madness, there was clearly a need for a bit of order. Otherwise, if the interaction with every website needed to be "learned" nobdoy would use the web anymore. Slowly we started converging towards what is now called web design. 

## Don't Make Users Think

A first important step on that road was a little book, that appeared in 2000, titled "Don't Make me Think" by S. Krug. It talked about web usability and about how a good software program or web site should let users accomplish their intended tasks as easily and directly as possible. 

Krug observed that we're not reading web pages; we're *scanning* them. And we're scanning because we're busy. And we want to get something done. That was true back then; and it's just as true now. 

This has implications on how we design a good website. Ideally a good website has: 

1. a clear hierarchy on each page = the more important something is, the more prominent it is
2. reused conventions = conventions help users make sense faster of what they see (e.g. login on top right, home page link as site logo on top left; a button is clickable on all it's body)
3. clearly defined areas on every page = things that are related logically, are also related visually
4. obvious markers of what's clickable (make a distinction between links and buttons)
5. as little noise as possible = this includes text; nobody wants to read a lot of text; but this also includes visual clutter too.

We face choices on the web; making the choices as simple as possible (mindless, if you want) is one of the main things that makes a web app easy to use. Also, making the important actions and info visible is important too.



### Hierarchy
- how important elements of a design appear in relation with one another
- ... 




### Color
- ditch hex for hsl
- you need more colors than you think
	- at least three kinds of palettes
		1. greys (you'll need more grays than you think)
		2. primary colors (what makes facebook feel blue)
		3. accent colors (highlight a new feature, warning message, dangerous action, positive trend)
- define your shades upfront
- 


### Shape & Layout
