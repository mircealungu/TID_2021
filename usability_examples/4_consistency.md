# Consistency and standards

Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.

## Examples

### Anita
In any other stores the prices is usually beneath the product on the shelf it's standing on (so the price is closest to the product), but not in this store.
Furthermore, in Anita_StorePrices3.PNG you can tell at the cashier, that it isn't 100% consistent throughout the whole store, where the price is under the product and in the rest of the store above the product.
