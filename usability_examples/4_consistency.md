# Consistency and standards

Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.

## Examples

### Jens

One button turns on the coffee machine and heats water. The second one (coffee cup logo) starts pouring coffee. The third one (steam logo) does not start the steam, but starts heating the water internally.
If you want to make the steam you have to turn on the right thing.
