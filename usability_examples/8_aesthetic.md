# Aesthetic and minimalist design

Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

The following photo is the front page of a foreign languages school that I worked in the past. 
The 3 columns that can be seen on the carousel, have exactly the same info that are in the 2nd column on the bottom of the page. 
Plus more irrelevant information appears on the page.
Thus, we are talking about useless content that they used to fill up the page. 
Moreover, in my opinion, the design is far from good and the opposite from minimalistic.
Example: The greek word Περισσότερα, which means More.. and which can be seen 3 times on the carousel, is in a red color and turns black on hover. 
And this is bad, as the next carousel pictures are dark-ish and you can barely see the word(which is a link <a>).
