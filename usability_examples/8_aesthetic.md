# Aesthetic and minimalist design

Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

## Examples

### Aliz

Grab and Go is the school's current canteen's app. I chose to add it here, as aesthetically this
app could improve a fair bit. 
The buy button could also include the price, which would merge the two existing components into one, making the screen a little less busy. The app also allows the user very little freedom in regards to moving forward and backward between views/actions, limiting their freedom in using the app (that is more "control"). 
Going into the "profile" section, a lot of information is presented to the user that is not directly related to personal profile information, hence irrelevant and also quite rarely needed to be accessed.
