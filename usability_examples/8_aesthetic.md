# Aesthetic and minimalist design

Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

I struggled with logging in to the learnit page for a while. I used to tilt my phone in order to get the log in option and just recently realized that the log in button is right below the "You are not logged in." statement in pretty much the same color as the background, making it almost impossible to see. It's a bit redundant to have both the long expression and the login button on such a small device. Personally, I would have opted for the more minimalistic design and placed the "log in" button where the "You are not logged in." statement is, because if the user gets the option to log in, the user will automatically know that they are not already logged in. Could possibly also belong to "Recognition rather than recall" since the log in button isn't very visible to the user.
