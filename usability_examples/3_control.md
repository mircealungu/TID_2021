# User control and freedom

Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked “emergency exit” to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.

## Examples

Evey time I log into kahoot.com, the site brings me to this page. The page is long, so if the user doesn't notice the small "Basic - Continue for free" text, they may spend a lot of time scrolling up and down on the page, looking for a way out. This of course is a strategy that almost forces the user to choose a subscription, but makes it very unclear and difficult for the user to exit this unwanted page.
