# Flexibility and efficiency of use

Accelerators — unseen by the novice user — may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.

## Examples

I believe both the pictures are examples of bad design in terms of efficiency of use. Both remote control and the christmas lights are making the trubble while using it. The remote control is not so intuitive, has far too much of the buttons, so when it comes to the connecting with tv software it causes misunderstandings and frustration.

The christmas lights are well designed as a decoration until we want to store them for the next year... There is no good solution provided by producers to store their product in the nice and save way. They usually provides the simple cartoon packaging, which intended design, I assume, points out that the product is one-time-use product and if you want to keep it for the next season, it is up to you how are you going to store it.

As we all experienced - re-using the same lights the next year couses flustration, while we have to spend a lot of time to untangle the lights before decorating on the tree. In this way experience of decoration of the christmas tree can turn to a nightmare.
