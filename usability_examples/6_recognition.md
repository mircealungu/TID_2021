# Recognition rather than recall

Minimize the userâ€™s memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.

## Examples

### Emma
After very light use, the buttons on my toaster disappeared (they should have made sure the icons were more permanent). For the last couple of years, I have just pressed a random button. I just realized, that the only button that actually means "toast this bread" is the last one. The one that is still visible, because I have never used it. I have been defrosting bread for years - apparently.

### Anita
It's not 100% clear and logic, how the prices are placed. It's not easily retrievable. If the customers isn't aware, you would think it's another price of the product, than it actually is.
