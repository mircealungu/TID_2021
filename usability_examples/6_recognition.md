# Recognition rather than recall

Minimize the user’s memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.

## Examples

### Emma
After very light use, the buttons on my toaster disappeared (they should have made sure the icons were more permanent). For the last couple of years, I have just pressed a random button. I just realized, that the only button that actually means "toast this bread" is the last one. The one that is still visible, because I have never used it. I have been defrosting bread for years - apparently.

### Elisabeth
The entrance to DR Byen from Amagerfælledvej uses an overload of signs to guide the vehicles when arriving. The information is a bit misleading since the sign on the gate directs the vehicles to the left. That makes me wonder if you should choose another entrance? Yet, the arrow on the road guides the arrived vehicles to stay on the right side. Furthermore, does the sign with the red circle symbolize that you cannot enter here. If you got your binocular or spyglasses with you will see it says: “without special permission”.
