# Match between system and the real world

The system should speak the usersâ€™ language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.

## Examples

### Anita
In StorePrices1 the store have drawn an arrow down, to show the customers, that the price is above the product, probably because of a lot of confussion about the price from the customers. Also because you don't know the name of the bun, so you wouldn't have any clue about the price (before the arrow drawn). This is an example of a thinking system, that didn't seem to work correctly accordingly to the users understanding. The drawn arrows is a quick fix of this.
